radiclette is an experimental zine running on Radicle. So radiclette is distributed, decentralized, and uncensorable. It will become more user-friendly as things advance. Clone the repo, read a post, open an issue to comment. Recommended format: the title of the issue should be "Comment to [title of the post]."
