About me: see my Github notebook:

I decided to try Radicle because a good friend told me good things about it. Also, I like the reference to Scuttlebutt and BitTorrent in the intro docs. So I want to see how it works and what it can be used for. I don't do coding (unless I really have to), so I'm more interested in other applications and I'm thinking of other use cases.
